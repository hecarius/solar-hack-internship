<h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
<meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1”>
<p> There are resources available to students to participate in events that will help further their career goals everywhere, but many students still find themselves struggling to access information about those resources. Studies show that over 3.2 million STEM jobs go unfilled every year due to the fact that many students are not inspired to follow STEM as a career because they are not able to access events that could very well spark a passion in them for the subject. Thus came **WEBSITE NAME**. Because we know students already have packed schedules, our goal is to make their lives a whole lot easier by putting all the information they could possibly need on our website. Here, they can learn about upcoming summer internship and job opportunities, as well as nearby science fairs, hackathons, workshops, career fairs, and college fairs – among so much more! Our website also aims to address the gender gap in people pursuing careers in the STEM field. We want students to use our website as a resource to achieve their successes.</p>
